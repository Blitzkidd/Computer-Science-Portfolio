## Code Review

Code reviews serve as an overview of a project's code and what it's progress is within the project, highlighting important details to change or update within the source code and output. Code reviews ensure consistency and compliance within the development cycle of a project and allows even higher standards to be met within a project. 

You can find the code review for my CS-300, CS-330, and CS-340 projects [here.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkApOy1SuHQ)

## Project 1: Software Engineering and Design (My Old Living Room in Open GL)

This first artifact within my portfolio is an OpenGL source application, creating a 3D space environment of what was my old living room in 2024, being a fully 3D space that the viewer can explore and roam, taking in the tv, birdhouse, or even relaxing on the chair right below the spawn of the camera. 

The artifact's design, report, and code can be found [here.] ( )

## Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structures (Course Planner)

This second artifact is an application within a terminal and utilizing C++ allows a user to craft a course planner and add in, edit, or delete details of any course within the database. This creates a useful tool for any college student within SNHU to plan out their days accordingly and keep up to date on information they will need.
