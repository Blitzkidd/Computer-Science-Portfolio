# Computer Science Portfolio

## Code Review

Code reviews serve as an overview of a project's code and what it's progress is within the project, highlighting important details to change or update within the source code and output. Code reviews ensure consistency and compliance within the development cycle of a project and allows even higher standards to be met within a project. 

You can find the code review for my CS-300, CS-330, and CS-340 projects [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkApOy1SuHQ).

## Project 1: Software Engineering and Design (My Old Living Room in Open GL)

This first artifact within my portfolio is an OpenGL source application, creating a 3D space environment of what was my old living room in 2024, being a fully 3D space that the viewer can explore and roam, taking in the tv, birdhouse, or even relaxing on the chair right below the spawn of the camera. 

The artifact's design, report, and code can be found [here](https://github.com/Blitzkidd/Computer-Science-Portfolio/tree/CS-330).

## Project 2: Algorithms and Data Structures (Course Planner)

This second artifact is an application within a terminal and utilizing C++ allows a user to craft a course planner and add in, edit, or delete details of any course within the database. This creates a useful tool for any college student within SNHU to plan out their days accordingly and keep up to date on information they will need. 

The artifact's design, report, and code can be found [here](https://github.com/Blitzkidd/Computer-Science-Portfolio/tree/CS-300).

## Project 3: Databases (Animal Shelter)

This third artifact is a database project remade from python and jupyter notebook to SQL and C++ to be a database for various information of animals within a shelter. This allows any shelter to have a small database to track various pets and their status like their sex, age, name, etc...

The artifact's design, report, and code can be found [here](https://github.com/Blitzkidd/Computer-Science-Portfolio/tree/CS-340).

## Project 4: Game Design (Metroidvania Prototype)

This artifact was one I wanted to include on this portfolio as it demonstrates my ability to work with a team on various projects. During this Metroidvania prototype that took around 6 weeks to develop, I was the level designer and coder, ensuring the environments and interactions all worked properly as well as created.

The artifact's design, report, and code can be found [here](https://github.com/EHaeffner/GAM-305---UrbanFantasy).

## Professional Self-Assessment

Over the course of my near 4 year career within the Computer Science program of Southern New Hampshire University, I have gotten the assistance needed to shape and concentrate on my professional and personal goals and paths. The path I walked gave me the knowledge of creating projects with code and video game engines as well as the team structures and bonding needed within the structures to ensure the development flow is going smoothly. This ePortfolio showcases my ability to plan and develop industry and professional-standard code for various purposes such as terminal applications to full games working in engine. This ePortfolio showcases a few projects I've worked on enough
